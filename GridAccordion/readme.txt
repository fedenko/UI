Thank you for purchasing this item!

This package contains 3 folders: examples, help and plugin_files.

The help folder contains the plugin's documentation.

The 'plugin_files' folder contains all the files that are part of this plugin. All those files, with the exception of jquery.gridAccordion.js, need to be included in the HTML page in which you want to use the plugin. jquery.gridAccordion.js contains the complete and documented source code. For production is better to use the compressed/minified file, jquery.gridAccordion.min.js.

The 'examples' folder contains 4 examples that you can use as a reference. 
- example and example2 shows you several ways in which you can customize the visual aspect of the accordion
- example_api demonstrates the use of the API. You can see how to call some of the accordion's public methods and also how to use callback functions.
- example_xml is an example that uses XML.
